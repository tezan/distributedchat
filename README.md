# A simple distributed chat

This is a very simple client-server and p2p app. You may use the client-server paradigmatic version starting the server and then using client.py on each clients' side to connect through the server. Alternatively you can use the p2p version (main.py).

Will update later as work towards the distributed version gets done.
